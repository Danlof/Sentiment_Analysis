# Sentiment_Analysis
from the ai.ipynb

these are lessons am getting from https://github.com/lmoroney from his book Ai and machine learning.

I have been able to do preprocessing of the 2 data sets one in json form and the other in csv format
some of the introductory preprocessing steps i have undertaken are:
- Tokenization
- Turning sentences into sequences
- using out of vocabulary tokens
- padding
- Removing stopwords

I have also worked with tensorflow datasets and performed the above mentioned steps.
